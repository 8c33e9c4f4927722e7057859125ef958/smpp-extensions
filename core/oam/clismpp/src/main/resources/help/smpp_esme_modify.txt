DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to modify the settings of an existing ESME configuration.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	Name			- The name of the ESME that is being modified.

	Optional Parameters

	Password		- Specify the new password.
				  It is used by the SMPP Server to authenticate the identity of 
				  the binding ESME. The Service Provider may require 
				  ESMEs to provide a password when binding to the SMPP Server.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	networkId       - indicates virtual subnetwork that this ESME belongs. SMS 
	                flows within same netwrokId, unless changed using mproc
	                (this is for multi-tenancy support). If this parameter is
                    skipped - networkId will be set to "0" when ESME creation.
                    If you do not use multi-tenancy support - set this value
                    to 0 or skip.

	split-long-messages - long messages will be split before sending to this
				  ESME destination. Default value is false.

	esme-ton 		- Specify new ESME TON. 
				  If the SMPP Session Type is CLIENT,
				  this TON will be used in the BIND request. If the SMPP
				  Session Type is SERVER, the incoming BIND request should
				  have the same TON as configured here. If the configured 
				  value is null (-1), SMPP Server will ignore it in both cases.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	esme-npi 		- Specify new ESME NPI. 
				  If the SMPP Session Type is CLIENT,
				  this NPI will be used in the BIND request. If the SMPP
				  Session Type is SERVER, the incoming BIND request should
				  have the same NPI as configured here. If the configured 
				  value is null (-1), SMPP Server will ignore it in both cases.		

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	esme-range 		- Specify ESME Address Range. 
				  If the SMPP Session Type is 
				  CLIENT, this Address Range will be used in the BIND 
				  request. If the SMPP Session Type is SERVER, the 
				  incoming BIND request should have the same Address Range
				  as configured here. If the configured value is 
				  null (-1), SMPP Server will ignore it in both cases.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	window-size 		- Specify new window size.
				  Default value is 1. 
				  The window size is the amount of unacknowledged requests
				  that are permitted to be outstanding/unacknowledged at 
				  any given time. If more requests are added, the 
				  underlying stack will throw an exception.

				  This value is set only when ESME is defined as Client 
				  side. For Server side this value is taken from the 
				  'SMPP Server Settings'.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.
	  
	connect-timeout		- Default value is 10000 milli seconds. 
				  This parameter is used to specify the time within which 
				  the connection to a remote SMPP Server should be 
				  established.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side. 
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	request-expiry-timeout	- Default value is -1 (disabled). 
				  This parameter is used to specify the time to wait in 
				  milli seconds for an endpoint to respond to before it 
				  expires.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side. 
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	client-bind-timeout  - Default value is 5000 milli seconds.
				  This parameter is used to specify the length of time
				  to wait for a bind response when the client connecting.
				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side. 

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	window-monitor-interval	- Default value is -1 (disabled).
				  This parameter is used to specify the time between 
				  executions of monitoring the window for requests that 
				  expire. It is recommended that this value, generally, 
				  either matches or is half the value of 
				  'request-expiry-timeout'. Therefore, in the worst case
				  scenario, a request could take upto 1.5 times the 
				  'requestExpiryTimeout' to clear out.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side. 
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	window-wait-timeout 	- Default value is 60000 milli seconds. 
				  This parameter is used to specify the time to wait 
				  until a slot opens up in the 'sendWindow'.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side. 
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	counters-enabled 	- Default value is true. 
				  When this is enabled, SMPP Server exposes the statistics for
				  SMPP connections.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side. 
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

				  The new value takes effect when SMPP is restarted.

	enquire-link-delay	- Default value is 30000 milli seconds. 
				  When SMPP Server connects to a remote server as CLIENT, it 
				  sends an 'ENQUIRE_LINK' after every configured 
				  enquire-link-delay.

				  0 means disabled. SMPP Server will not send ENQUIRE_LINK.

				  The new value takes effect immediately.

    enquire-link-delay-server - Default value is 0 milli seconds. 
				  When SMPP Server connects to a remote server as SERVER, it 
				  sends an 'ENQUIRE_LINK' after every configured 
				  enquire-link-delay-server.

				  0 means disabled. SMPP Server will not send ENQUIRE_LINK.

				  The new value takes effect immediately.

	link-drop-server - Time in milliseconds after which if ESME plays a SERVER role 
				  and this option is enabled (> 0) SMPP Server will drop the esme
				  session if for this time there is no traffic in the ESME
				  (no incoming SMPP messages).
				  Values 0 or <0 disable the option.
				  If enquire-link-delay-server is enabled then link-drop-server
				  option value is not taken into account (it is always disabled.)
				  Default value is 0 (that means that the option is disabled).
				  
	charging-enabled	- Flag to enable or disable charging for every SMS 
				  arriving from SIP.

				  The new value takes effect immediately.

	source-ton		- Every SMS coming into the SMPP Server via this ESME should have
				  the same 'source_addr_ton' as the value configured here.

				  If this configured value is null(-1) or not null and 
				  matches, the SMPP Server will compare the
				  'source_addr_npi' and 'source_addr_range' as explained 
				  below. 

				  If it doesn't match, the SMPP Server will reject this SMS with 
				  an error code '0x0000000A' indicating 
				  Invalid Source Address.

				  The new value takes effect immediately.

	source-npi		- Every SMS coming into the SMPP Server via this ESME should have
				  the same 'source_addr_npi' as the value configured here.
				  configured here. 

				  If this configured value is null(-1)
				  or not null and matches, the SMPP Server will compare the 
				  'source_addr_range' as below. 

				  If it doesn't match, the SMPP Server will reject this 
				  SMS with an error code '0x0000000A' indicating 
				  Invalid Source Address.

				  The new value takes effect immediately.

	source-range		- Every SMS coming into the SMPP Server via this ESME should have
				  the same 'source_addr_range' as the value configured 
				  here.This is a regular java expression and 
				  default value is ^[0-9a-zA-Z]*. 

				  If it matches, the SMPP Server will accept the incoming SMS 
				  and process further.

				  If it doesn't match, the SMPP Server will reject this 
				  SMS with an error code '0x0000000A' indicating 
				  Invalid Source Address.

				  The new value takes effect immediately.

	routing-ton		- The DefaultSmsRoutingRule will try to match the 
				  'dest_addr_ton' of outgoing SMS with the value 
				  configured here. If this configured value is null(-1) 
				  or not null and matches, the SMPP Server will compare the
				  'dest_addr_npi' and 'destination_addr' as explained 
				  below. If it doesn't match, the SMPP Server will select the 
				  next ESME in the list for matching routing rule.

				  DefaultSmsRoutingRule will consider ESME for routing 
				  only if
				  1) SmppBindType is TRANSCEIVER
				  2) SmppBindType is RECEIVER and 
				  SmppSession.Type is SERVER
				  3) SmppBindType is TRANSMITTER and 
				  SmppSession.Type is CLIENT

				  The new value takes effect immediately.

	routing-npi		- The DefaultSmsRoutingRule will try to match the 
				  'dest_addr_npi' of outgoing SMS with the value
				  configured here. If this configured value is null(-1)
				  or not null and matches, the SMPP Server will compare the 
				  'destination_addr' as below. If it doesn't match, the 
				  SMPP Server will select the next ESME in the list for matching 
				  routing rule.

				  DefaultSmsRoutingRule will consider ESME for routing 
				  only if
				  1) SmppBindType is TRANSCEIVER
				  2) SmppBindType is RECEIVER and 
				  SmppSession.Type is SERVER
				  3) SmppBindType is TRANSMITTER and 
				  SmppSession.Type is CLIENT

				  The new value takes effect immediately.

	routing-range		- The DefaultSmsRoutingRule will try to match the 
				  'destination_addr' of outgoing SMS with the value
				  configured here. This is a regular java expression and 
				  default value is ^[0-9a-zA-Z]*. If it matches, the SMPP Server
				  will send the SMS out over this SMPP connection. If it 
				  doesn't match, the SMPP Server will select the next ESME in 
				  the list for matching routing rule.

				  DefaultSmsRoutingRule will consider ESME for routing 
				  only if
				  1) SmppBindType is TRANSCEIVER
				  2) SmppBindType is RECEIVER and 
				  SmppSession.Type is SERVER
				  3) SmppBindType is TRANSMITTER and 
				  SmppSession.Type is CLIENT

	                do not have UDHs inside and have GSM7 encoding (DCS==0). The 
	                default GSM data coding table is mostly used. Possible values:
                       = 0  : default GSM data coding table
                       = 13 : urdu (arabic) national language shift table
                       = 1  : the national language locking shift value must be 
                              obtained from the option national-language-single-shift

                              that is defined at SMPP Server general level.							
	
	dest-addr-send-limit - This command is used to set the value of Destination
					Address Sending Limit table. destaddrsendlimit will be
					used to limit the sent unconfirmed messages for a 
					destination address for an ESME. This is SMPP Server level
					and can be overwritten for each ESME created.
					Default value: 0 - no limitations
							  
	min-message-length    - This paramter is used to specify the minimum
					message length (in characters) acceptable to
					the SMPP Server, for messages coming from this ESME.
					
					If an incoming message length is less than the
					min-message-length it will be rejected by SMPP Server.

					If an incoming message length is more than the
					max-message-length it will be rejected by SMPP Server.
					
					The default value for this parameter is "-1" and it
					implies "no limitations". Any other negative value
					also implies "no limitations".
					
	overload-threshold    - This value may be used by application to compare 
					messages queue size with it and based on outcome mark ESME 
					as 'overloaded'. Then based on this state further 
					functionality may be applied by application, such as 
					bypassing this ESME while sending new messages.
	 
	normal-threshold 	  - This value is opposite to overload-threshold and might 
					be used as a condition to mark current ESME state as 
					not 'overloaded' and consequent resuming of sending new messages 
					through this ESME.
					Default value is -1, otherwise negative value will be ignored.
					It won't be possible to set Normal Threshold to -1 if 
					Overload Threshold is currently set.
