= Configuring as a Standalone library

If you intend to use the Stack as a standalone library without using JBoss Application Server or JSLEE RAs, then you must make your own implementation of classes that was implemented at SMPP RA level.
 
For this case you need to implement `org.restcomm.smpp.SmppSessionHandlerInterface` (it is implemented at SMPP RA), set it to `SmppManagement` before starting of `SmppManagement` stack.
