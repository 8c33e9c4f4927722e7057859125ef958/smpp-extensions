[[_logical_divisions]]
== Logical Design

We usually use {this-platform} {this-application} as it is displayed in a picture below. We need to deploy Cloudhopper SMPP stack and SMPP-Extensions under a JBOSS or WildFly server and then an SMPP RA must be separately deployed.

For more details regarding installation, please refer to the {this-platform} {this-application} Installation Guide.

[[_dir_structure]]
== Directory Structure

The top-level directory is named {path} and immediately below this are sub-directories named _docs_, _oam_, _schell_, _jboss5_ and _wildfly_.
All the functional modules of the Stack reside in the _jboss5_ and _wildfly_ folders.

== Functional Blocks

The major functional modules of the {this-application} are: 

. {this-application} _[dir: {this-folder}-jboss5 and {this-folder}-wildfly]_
. Shell _[dir: shell]_
. GUI _[dir: oam]_

The following sub-sections discuss in detail about the functionality of these individual components. 


[[_design_overview_shell]]
=== Shell - Comman Line Interface 

`Shell` is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that will allow you to manage different aspects of {this-platform}  {this-application}  in an interactive manner.
It connects to different instances of {this-platform}  {this-application}  which manages `SMPP server` settings and a list of `ESMEs` . Usually `Shell` will be invoked from a remote machine(remote to `Linksets` and application protocols).  

[[_design_overview_gui]]
=== Graphical User Interface

The Graphical User Interface will allow you to manage different aspects of {this-platform} {this-application} through a convenient user-friendly interface.
You can launch the GUI in any Web Browser and manage the Stack instance efficiently using the GUI operations.
